# Automated_Sunflower_Solar_Panel
This is an IoT-based project that works on an ESP-8266 Node-MCU and Arduino  Nano Board with an LDR sensor, there will be a rotatable Solar panel system that has  the initial(closed) position during the night time but when the light is available in day  time the solar system automatically wakes up through sensing the light presence.
