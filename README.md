# Automated_Sunflower_Solar_Panel
This is an IoT-based project that works on an ESP-8266 Node-MCU and Arduino Nano Board with an LDR sensor. There will be a rotatable solar panel system that has the initial (closed) position during the night, but when the light is available during the day, the solar system automatically wakes up by sensing the light presence.
